    A Channel is an object used to communicate between `Thread` objects.  Different threads can send
    messages on the same Channel to communicate with each other.  Messages can be sent and received
    on a Channel using `Channel:push` and `Channel:pop`, and are received in a first-in-first-out
    fashion. The following types of data can be passed through Channels: nil, boolean, number,
    string, lightuserdata, table, vector, and any LÃ–VR object.
